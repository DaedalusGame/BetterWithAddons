# The Worldscale

![Centerpiece](block:betterwithaddons:world_scale_active@0)
![Scale](block:betterwithaddons:world_scale@0)

The Worldscale is a structure that protects chunks from the destructive tools of other players. It's use is intended for faction or anarchy servers, where it's normally better to hide in a cave than build aboveground structures.
The polished Worldscale is the centerpiece of the structure. To function, it must have any banner placed on top of it. The more complex the banner design, the better, as it will be more difficult to counterfeit.
Merely placing the Worldscale will protect the chunk it is in. To protect more chunks, it can be extended in a flat plane shape. The individual scale pieces are not required to be connected to the centerpiece.

![Example](betterwithaddons:docs/imgs/worldscale.png)

Two Worldscales cannot claim the same chunks, when attempted, the block on the more recently placed Worldscale will fracture, showing that a chunk cannot be claimed (this does not destroy the scale, and it can be mined as usual)

![Broken Scale](block:betterwithaddons:world_scale@1)

An active Worldscale will inhibit blockbreaking in all claimed chunks. Blocks will be much harder to break, whether a suitable tool is used or not. There is no change to blast resistance of individual blocks, so explosions can still be used to blast through walls. Containers will also remain unprotected, but blocks can be placed on chests to prevent players from opening them.
This effect can be negated by wearing a copy of the banner placed on the centerpiece on your head.
