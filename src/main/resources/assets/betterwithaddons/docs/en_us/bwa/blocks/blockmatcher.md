# Block Matcher

#[Block Matcher](block:betterwithaddons:block_matcher@0)

The Block Matcher is a simple redstone device that compares blocks placed at opposite ends of it and emits a redstone signal if they are the same.
This comparison may be too loose or too strict sometimes, so a attached Comparator can read some finer matching aspects.
