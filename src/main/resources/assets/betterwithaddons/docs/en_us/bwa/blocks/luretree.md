Alicio Trees can be planted on any suitable soil. They will make a terrifying sound when they grow to maturity. Alicio Trees secrete a blood-red sap that attracts animals.
In order for them to attract animals, its grotesque face must be fed with items. See below for a table of food values.

The wood that Alicio Trees produce when chopped is unfortunately too spongy to be used for anything but fuel, but its terrifying face can be placed elsewhere as decoration.
