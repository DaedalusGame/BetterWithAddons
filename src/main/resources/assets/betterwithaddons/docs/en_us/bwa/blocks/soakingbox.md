# Soaking Unit

![Soaking Unit](block:betterwithaddons:cherrybox@0)

The Soaking Unit is used to soak items in cold water. This process takes a long time, so you should probably build more than one. It must be placed in a specific way and only functions if all requirements are met.

Just as the drying Unit must be submerged in sand, the Soaking Unit must be submerged in water to function. The edge of a frozen stream is an ideal location to setup many Soaking Units.
