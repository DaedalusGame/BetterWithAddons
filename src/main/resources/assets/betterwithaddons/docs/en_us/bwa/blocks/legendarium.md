# Hall of Legends

![Hall of Legends](block:betterwithaddons:legendarium@0)

The Hall of Legends can be used to bypass the maximum repair limit on anvils. A broken tool with a name and enchantments that can no longer be repaired on an anvil (Too Expensive) can be turned in by right-clicking.
The tool will be stored in the Hall of Legends. The next tool will only be able to be turned in after some time passes. After 7 artifacts are turned in, the first one can be taken out by punching the Hall of Legends.
The resulting shards can then be repaired at an anvil, using a fresh tool/armorpiece, keeping all enchantments but resetting the repair cost.

![Artifact Frame](item:betterwithaddons:artifact_frame@0)

Additionally, turned in artifacts can be displayed in special item frames. The frames can be placed within the influence area of a Hall of Legends and will automatically fill with artifacts as they are turned in.
Frames with artifacts cannot be broken without breaking the block behind the frame. To empty all frames, simply right-click on the Hall with a frame in hand. Right-clicking again will populate the frames again.
