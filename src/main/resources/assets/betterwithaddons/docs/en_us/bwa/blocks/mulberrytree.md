# Mulberry Tree

![Mulberry Sapling](block:betterwithaddons:sapling_mulberry@0)

Mulberry (or Paper Mulberry) is a flowering plant commonly occurring in faraway eastern lands. So faraway indeed, that it will be impossible to find in this world. Instead it must be created from another sapling on an Ancestral Infuser.
Mulberry wood and bark is very soft. This makes it less usable for common building and crafting, but also makes it very useful for creating paper.

The berries of this tree are often used in herbal medicines. They can be stewed into a laxative that decreases the time it takes for an animal to produce dung after it has been fed.
