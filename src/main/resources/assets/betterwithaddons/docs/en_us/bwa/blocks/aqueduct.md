#[Aqueduct](block:betterwithaddons:aqueduct@3)

Aqueducts can be used to transfer liquids over long distances. The Aqueduct block must be placed as a channel with a rim, similar to the Salination Pond. The rim need not be made from aqueduct blocks.
Water can be input from any source block. This includes water sources created by Screwpumps. Aqueducts can be emptied by blocking upstream flow.

Aqueducts do not contain source blocks.
