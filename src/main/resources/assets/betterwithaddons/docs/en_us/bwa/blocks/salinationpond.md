# Salination Pond

![Salination Pond](block:betterwithaddons:pond_base@1)

The Salination Pond is a structure for evaporating water and obtaining salt.

![Sandy Clay](block:betterwithaddons:pond_base@0)

First, Sandy Clay must be obtained and placed in bright sunlight. Over time, the Sandy Clay will harden into pond base blocks. Water on top of Sandy Clay will prevent it from hardening.
The pond base should be placed as a flat plane. The pond must also have a rim made from solid blocks. Refer to the below schematic for an example setup.

The pond can be filled either with source water blocks, or flowing water, but only if all water in the pool has flown at maximum 4 blocks from the closest water source.
Over time, the water in the pool will turn stagnant, provided it's exposed to enough sunlight. The water in the pool will go through 3 stages: Stagnant Water, Brine and Saturated Brine.
Flowing water will prevent stagnant water from becoming brine.

![Salt Layer](block:betterwithaddons:salt_layer@0)

After fully evaporating, the pool will be filled with a thin layer of salt, which can be harvested using a wooden bowl. Attempting to shovel the salt up or using some other rough tool will simply strew it into the winds.
