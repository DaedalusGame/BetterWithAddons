The Netted Screen is used for processing a variety of different materials. It must be placed in a specific way and only functions if all requirements are met.
There are several variants of the Netted Screen which must be built differently.

 * [Sand Funnel](sandnet.md)
 * [Filter](waternet.md)
 * [Melter](firenet.md)

Note that, for designs requiring water, any water is suitable, even flowing water or the output of a screwpump.
