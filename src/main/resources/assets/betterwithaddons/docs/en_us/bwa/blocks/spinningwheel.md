# Spinning Wheel

![Spinning Wheel](block:betterwithaddons:loom@0)

The Spinning Wheel is a machine that can be used to automatically spin fibers into cloth. Additionally, it can
automatically wrap loose cloth around a bolt to store it more compactly.

To use a Spinning Wheel, it must be powered from any side, either by a handcrank or an axle.
Additionally, a Spindle must be attached to the Spinning Wheel on any side other than the wheel, as the wheel is too fragile to rotate the Spindle.

After the Spindle is attached, cloth or fibers should be dropped on the Spindle to be spun into cloth or bolts.
Due to the rotary forces involved, the resulting cloth or bolt will be sent flying away from the Spindle, but never into solid blocks, and never upwards.

The Spindle can automatically craft ![Hemp Cloth](item:betterwithmods:material@4) and ![Rope Blocks](block:betterwithmods:aesthetic@4)

Additionally, it also spins cloth items into their compressed bolt form, but the spindle becomes part of the bolt of cloth. For automation, a Block Dispenser or similar should be used.
