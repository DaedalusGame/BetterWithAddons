# Ancestral Infuser

![Ancestral Infuser](block:betterwithaddons:ancestry_infuser@0)

The Ancestral Infuser is used to infuse crafted items with the spirit of ancient japanese culture. This can be done in two ways, by crafting the item in the Infuser, or by simply throwing an item on top of it.
Both of these operations consume a variable amount of souls depending on the item created or transformed. This number can be seen in JEI.

To use the Ancestral Infuser, Infused Soul Sand containing [spirits](../mechanics/spirits.md) must be placed directly underneath the Infuser. Additionally, there must be a 1 block gap in each cardinal and diagonal direction from the Infuser and the Soul Sand.
It must also be very dark to use the Infuser. It must atleast be dark enough for mobs to spawn in the vicinity. Redstone torches can be used to provide a dim light, so long as they are not placed in the 1 block air gap.

A correctly setup Ancestral Infuser will turn bright red if Spirits are contained in the Soul Sand.

Items placed into the Crafting Grid will pop out when the GUI is closed.
