# Block Matcher

![Block Matcher](block:betterwithaddons:block_matcher@0)

The Block Matcher is a simple redstone device that compares blocks placed at opposite ends of it and emits a redstone signal if they are the same.
This comparison may be too loose or too strict sometimes, so a attached Comparator can read some finer matching aspects.
The signal levels from the comparator are as follows:
 0. Not at all similar
 1. Same solidity
 2. Same material
 3. Similar block
 4. Exact match
