Weight Sensors are redstone devices that emit a single based on the weight of a container placed on top of it. Wooden Weight Sensors emit if the container above contains atleast one item or even a drip of fluid. Stone Weight Sensors only emit if the container is full of items or liquid.

Other blocks that can be measured are listed below:

Cauldron - Fill Status
Anchor - Always on if the Anchor is facing down
Platforms and Iron Walls - Detects all creatures on the platforms, wooden sensors output if any creatures are present, stone sensors will output only if more creatures than platform blocks are present. Note that Iron Walls do not count as platforms.
